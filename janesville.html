<p>When I came to Janesville everything was different.Different language,different culture,different style of hockey.I lived with best billet family around 20 miles from Janesville.They helped me with language and everything what I need.I had really good season out there and I improve myself to be better hockey player.One day, Coach from Maine saw one of my games and offer me scholarship to play for University of Maine.I was suprised because I never expect I would be student.In Europe it is different.Everyone wants to play just hockey and just focus on hockey.I decided to accept this big challange.I was so proud  especially because I made my parents so happy.  </p>
