<p>I started play hockey career in the team called Zilina and the rink was  25 miles away from my home. I had the elementary school and the high school here, and  I played hockey here as well. In Zilina I learned how to play hockey and I got my first invitation to national team . After 8 years in this team I got the chance to play in Sweden  and I decided to move there because I would like to develop myself as a hockey player in Sweden.Sweden is one of the best country for developing good hockey players.<p>
