<p> After a couple years and bad experiences in Finland I decided come back to Slovakia play for national team.We played in 2 different leagues against professionals player so we had a lot of games and a lot of opportunity to be better.I have been there  one year and I played over 80 games.Before world junior championship under 20 I broke my jaw.I was not able to play on WJC20.I was so sad about that because It was my dream play for my country on this big event.I get opportunity to play hockey in USA.I decide to leave and have fun for rest of my junior carrer but I did not expect  what would happened in USA.Next stop Janesville.
